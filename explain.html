  <h1>Adding command lines to home mac</h1>
    <p>It took a while, and some google fu, but I was able to add atom, and the correct command lines to my home mac.</p>
    <p>I was also able to pull the github repository to my computer and open it via atom!</p>
    <p>So a quick list of what I was able to do:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and install atom</li>
        <li>Create a new directory</li>
        <li>Clone my respository into that directory</li>
        <li>Make changes to the repository</li>
        <li>Commit the changes locally via terminal</li>
        <li>Push the new repository to GitHub</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Let's hope this works</p>
